    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="center_div">
      <p id="about">
        I love to play volleyball, and just recently finished up my 18's season
        at nationals, where we finished 30th in the nation. I enjoy studying
        subjects like rocket propulsion and quantum mechanics in my free time.
        I'm currently reading the textbook "Rocket Propulsion Elements the 9th
        Edition" by George Sutton and Oscar Biblarz. I am also making a summary
        of the text so it can be understood more easily by a younger audience
        who are similar to my younger self when I started reading a previous
        edition when I was 12 years old. I love to design and create things, so
        I will regularly CAD up one of my ideas and 3D print it. I have created
        and printed various planes and airfoils this way.
